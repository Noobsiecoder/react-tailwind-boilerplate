### What is Node and NPM?

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the Chrome V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
**NPM** (Node package manager) is a tool which will allow you to install third party libraries (other people's code) by using the command line.
